## Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language. It was 
developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. Java is widely used
for developing web applications, mobile applications, enterprise software, and embedded systems.

## Manual Building

To compile a Java program, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

```
project/
â”‚â”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ org/example/Main.java
â””â”€â”€ target/ (this will store compiled classes)
```

```bash
javac -d target src/org/example/Main.java
```

When executing a Java class, the fully qualified class name (FQCN) should match its package structure ,
but it should not include the target/classes directory.

```bash
java -cp target/classes org.example.Main  
```
`-cp target/classes` sets the classpath to the compiled files.  
`org.example.Main` correctly represents the package and class name.
