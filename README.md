## Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language. It was 
developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. Java is widely used
for developing web applications, mobile applications, enterprise software, and embedded systems.

## Manual Building

```Java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

To be udpated.
```bash
javac Main.java
java Main  
```
